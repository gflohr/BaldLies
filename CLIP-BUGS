CLIP is the protocol for communicating with FIBS compatible servers.  It
is documented at http://www.fibs.com/fibs_interface.html.

This file lists a couple of corrections and clarifications.

Toggles
=======

The toggle "moves" is a per-game toggle like "double" and "greedy".
It is always reset to "NO" at the start of a new game.  Note: new game,
not new match!

Board State
===========

The two "colors" for FIBS are X and O (the letter, not zero).  For the first
game in a match, the colors are picked randomly.  After that, the server
switches sides at the start of every new game.

You must take care to not confuse the "colors" O and X with the players.
The second player is your opponent, or the opponent of the player you are
currently watching.  The first one is yourself or the player you are watching.
The colors (O and X) of these two players have to determined from the
board state.

Player O always moves from 24 to 1, X plays from 1 to 24.

X is represented as -1 as a color and by negative pip counts.  O is
represented as 1 as a color and by positive pip counts.

The colon-separated items in a board state are:

0: The word "board"
1: Player 1.  This is always "You", when you are playing yourself,
   or the name of the player you are watching.
2: Player 2.  Your opponent's name or the name of the opponent of the
   player you are watching.
3: The length of the match or 9999 for unlimited matches.
4: Player 1's score in the match.
5: Player 2's score in the match.
6-31: 26 numbers giving the board. Positions 0 and 25 represent the bars 
   for the players. Positive numbers represent 0's pieces and negative numbers 
   represent X's pieces.  The first number (index 6) represents O's
   bar, the last number (index 31) represents X's bar.
32: Who is on turn?
    -1: It is X's turn
     1: It is O's turn
     0: Nobody's turn, aka game over, or the situation between games,
        where both players have to send a "join".
33: Player 1's first die.
34: Player 1's second die.
35: Player 2's frist die.
36: Player 2's second die.
